Add `preact.config.js` in the root directory in order to expand the default webpack functionality, by using the following template:
[preact.config.example.js](https://github.com/DanielT404/vitae-frontend/blob/main/preact.config.example.js)

## Additional CLI commands

```bash
# lint source code
npm run lint
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [preact-cli Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
